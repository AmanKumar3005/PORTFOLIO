//             Hello, my name is Aman Kumar. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the prestigious Vellore Institute of Technology. As a passionate and dedicated student, I have cultivated a strong interest in MERN technology and Java, which are the driving forces behind my academic and professional pursuits.
//             One of my notable achievements is my participation in a MERN internship offered by Ethnus, where I gained practical experience and a deeper understanding of full-stack development. This experience was instrumental in enhancing my skills and solidifying my enthusiasm for this domain. Additionally, I have earned a certificate for this internship, which stands as a testament to my commitment and expertise in MERN technology.
//             In addition to my proficiency in MERN stack and Java, I possess basic knowledge of Python. I have also completed an internship in Applied Machine Learning from the University of Michigan through Coursera. This internship allowed me to explore the fascinating world of machine learning and its applications, further broadening my technical horizon.
